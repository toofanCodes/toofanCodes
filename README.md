# Hi there, I'm Jaya Saran Teja Pavuluri (Saran) üëã

I'm a Analytical Engineer who likes to stay updated with rapidly evolving tech landscape. Being a recent **MS in Business Analytics** graduate from Seattle University, I am seeking roles where I can showcase my skills and contribute .

I love building end-to-end solutions that tackle real-world business problems. My approach is simple: if a process is manual or inefficient, I look for ways to automate and improve it. I get excited about turning raw data into data-driven products(be it personal life or professional), whether that‚Äôs a predictive model to forecast revenue, an ETL pipeline to ensure data integrity, or an interactive dashboard that helps leaders make smarter decisions.

I‚Äôve worked across **Go-to-Market strategy**, **financial and operational analytics**, and **supply chain optimization**, which gives me a big-picture perspective on how to use data to drive success throughout an organization.

## üîé What I Do

- **For Strategic Analyst Roles (Business, Finance, People Analytics)**  
  Translate complex data into actionable strategy. Help teams make sense of market trends, streamline processes, forecast outcomes, and connect day-to-day performance with financial results. Deliver clear, data-backed recommendations that lead to growth and efficiency.

- **For Data Engineering Roles (BIE, Analytics Engineer)**  
  Build and automate scalable data solutions from the ground up. Design data models (like star schemas), develop custom ETL pipelines on AWS, and create BI reporting layers with Tableau, Power BI, or QuickSight that bring insights to everyone in the organization.

## üìñ Data Storytelling

I believe great analytics should tell a story that people can actually understand and act on. I use frameworks like:

- **Pyramid Principle**  
  Structure insights from the top down so stakeholders immediately grasp the main point.

- **MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)**  
  Organize analysis logically without overlaps or gaps, making recommendations clear and actionable.

- **SCR (Situation-Complication-Resolution)**  
  Craft narratives that explain where we are, what challenges we face, and what we should do next.

These frameworks help me turn complex datasets into compelling, audience-focused stories that drive better strategic decisions.
